# Enhanced-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Word-Embeddings-Word2Vec-GloVe-Case-Study-2

> A Gen AI & LLM course case study on sentiment analysis using **Word2Vec** and **GloVe** embeddings for deeper contextual understanding.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on using **word embeddings** to analyze customer reviews and classify sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).  
Unlike traditional TF–IDF models, embeddings like **Word2Vec** and **GloVe** capture semantic and contextual meanings, improving prediction accuracy.

The workflow includes **text preprocessing**, **embedding generation**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **comparison** of embedding-based models.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Customer reviews contain meaningful insights about satisfaction and product quality.  
Conventional models fail to capture the true context behind words.  
This project utilizes **Word2Vec** and **GloVe embeddings** to build sentiment classifiers that better interpret natural language and enhance prediction results.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean textual review data.  
- Generate vector representations using **Word2Vec** and **GloVe**.  
- Train models (e.g., **Random Forest**) on the generated embeddings.  
- Compare embedding-based models with classical TF–IDF approaches.  
- Identify the most effective embedding technique for sentiment prediction.

## ⚙️ Methodology
**1. Dataset Preparation:** Import and clean product review dataset.  
**2. Preprocessing:** Tokenize text, remove stopwords, and apply lemmatization.  
**3. Embedding Generation:**  
   - **Word2Vec:** Trained locally for domain relevance.  
   - **GloVe:** Pre-trained embeddings used for contextual richness.  
**4. Modeling:** Train Random Forest and other ML models on embeddings.  
**5. Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix used for comparison.  
**6. Analysis:** Assess embedding performance in capturing sentiment context.

## 📊 Results
- **Word embeddings** outperformed traditional Bag-of-Words and TF–IDF models.  
- **Random Forest** achieved strong performance using embeddings.  
- **Word2Vec** excelled in context-specific patterns, while **GloVe** captured global semantics.  
- Embedding-based models generalized effectively on unseen data.
